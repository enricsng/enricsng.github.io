I recently picked up a Jisulife Pro 1S fan from Shopee. It's a great little fan, but I found it irritating to hold onto it while walking around.

One day, I was scrolling the hallowed halls of Taobao and I saw a belt clip fan. I thought, "Hmm, I could probably make it better." So I sat down and started thinking.

One of the benefits of the Jisulife fan is that it is very powerful and reasonably light. It has a 5000mAh battery, which lasts for a long time. Compared to the fan from Taobao, it is much more powerful and has a longer battery life.
